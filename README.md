# Quantum Circuit Mapper
- This project develops a quantum circuit mapping algorithm for computational algorithms to execute them on real quantum computing HW.

## Environment
- Language :  Python3
- OS:  Ubuntu 20.04 

Note: It does not work well on Mac OS now, but will be fixed soon.

## Prerequisites
To run the project successfully, you need to install the following packages included in "requirements.txt" after installation.
- *simplejson*, *pandas*, *networkx*, *progress*, *qubitmapping*

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Note that the packages *qubitmapping* is developed by Y.Hwang for this project.

## Installation
We encourage installing this project by cloning the source code from GitHub server.
But, we hope that this project is installed via pip.
```
bash
git clone https://github.com/YongsooHWANG/qcmapper.git
```

## Usage

Please see [How To Use.md](docs/HowToUse.md) to know how to use the package.

For the sample demonstration codes for Steane code and Golay code, please see [Demo.md](docs/Demo.md).
